/*
	Package implementing reliable storage of the global and entity stores,
	as well as reliable storage of both core and client node state
	requiring reliable persistence.

	Handles executing instructions once they are known to be chosen,
	as well as automatically removing earlier instructions.

	Provides a startup function, functions to read and set state,
	and transactions and locks for atomically performing sequences of
	operations. Provides callback registration functions for reacting
	to newly chosen instructions, applied instructions, changes of
	proposal number and leader node ID, and changes to degraded status.

	The callback for applied instructions provides the idempotent version
	of the instructionâ€™s changeset.

	Client nodes do not use all the available state.
